# Cognitive Science Quiz App

## Introduction

The Cognitive Science Quiz App is a web-based application aimed at exploring cognitive science concepts through an interactive quiz format. This project provides an opportunity to apply basic coding skills to create a simple yet engaging application that promotes learning and understanding of cognitive science themes.

## Project Description

The Cognitive Science Quiz App features multiple-choice questions covering key concepts such as memory, perception, attention, decision-making, and problem-solving. Users can select answers and receive immediate feedback on their responses.

## Key Features

- **Quiz Interface:** A user-friendly interface for presenting quiz questions and answer choices.
  
- **Question Database:** A database of cognitive science questions and corresponding correct answers.
  
- **Scoring System:** A mechanism to track users' performance and provide feedback on quiz results.

## Methodology

The development of the Cognitive Science Quiz App involves basic web development using Next.js, a React framework. The focus is on creating a functional quiz application with rudimentary features and content within a one-week timeframe.

## Expected Deliverables

- A functional Cognitive Science Quiz App accessible via a web browser.
- Basic documentation outlining the app's features and functionality.
- A video-recorded walkthrough demonstrating the app's code and explaining its cognitive science-related themes.

## Timeline

- **Days 1-2:** Planning and design phase, including brainstorming quiz questions and sketching app interface.
  
- **Days 3-5:** Development phase, building the quiz app using Next.js and populating it with quiz questions.
  
- **Days 6-7:** Testing phase, debugging code, finalizing app features, and recording walkthrough video.

## Resources

- Next.js framework for web development.
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Open-access resources on cognitive science topics for quiz question inspiration.

## Significance and Impact

The Cognitive Science Quiz App aims to provide users with an engaging platform for learning about cognitive science concepts in an interactive way. By combining coding skills with cognitive science themes, this project promotes both technical proficiency and cognitive understanding.
